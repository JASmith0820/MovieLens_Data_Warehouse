# MovieLens_Data_Warehouse  
<br>    
This repository contains a Data Warehouse created for the MovieLens data. MovieLens is a free movie recommendation tool in which a user provides feedback on movies he/she has watched and receives customized recommendations. You can read more about MovieLens on their website at https://movielens.org/. The datafile contained approximately 1 million MovieLens movie recommendations. Although no user ID was provided, one can see user demographic data, the genre category of the movie, and the rating (between 1 and 5) that the user gave the film.
